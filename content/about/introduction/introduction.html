      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This introduction to the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) explains the purpose of the APG, who it intends to serve, and how it is organized.
      </p>

      <section id="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose of the APG</h2>
        <p>
          The APG explains how to develop web experiences for people who rely on assistive technologies and keyboard interfaces.
          It includes a library of accessible user interface patterns, example implementations of the patterns, and guidance that explain how to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make common user interface patterns accessible by using features of the
            <a class="specref" href="#abstract">Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) specification</a>
            in combination with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use ARIA, HTML, and CSS to implement fundamental accessibility practices, such as providing accessible names, enabling keyboard interaction, conveying page structure to assistive technologies, and supporting high contrast operating system settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The primary aim of the APG is to increase the availability of robust accessible experiences by building broad understanding  and encouraging adoption of web accessibility practices that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are consistent with the intent of ARIA, HTML, CSS, and related  specifications.</li>
          <li>Support assistive technology interoperability.</li>
          <li>Promote practical techniques for developing modern GUIs that both support usability for people with disabilities and conform with WCAG requirements.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="apg-is-informative">
        <h2>APG is Not a Normative Standard</h2>
        <p>
          The accessibility guidance in the APG is different from accessibility requirements specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a>.
          WCAG and ARIA are "W3C normative technical standards" while the APG is an "informative" resource.
          W3C normative technical standards, which are formally known as "W3C Recommendations", have conformance models that define how to comply with the requirements documented in the standard.
          Those requirements are developed using a rigorous process defined by
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process#rec-track">W3C Recommendation Track</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APG does not specify normative requirements and thus does not have a conformance model.
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/aria-practices">ARIA Authoring Practices Task Force</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria">ARIA Working Group</a>,
          uses consensus to ensure APG guidance is consistent with the ARIA specification, but it is not bound by the W3C Recommendation Track process.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Exercise Caution If Deviating from APG Guidance</h2>
        <p>
          While APG is not a standard, its patterns and practices do convey requirements from normative standards.
          The patterns attempt to describe a range of variation that satisfies the requirements of  relevant accessibility specifications, and they provide links to those specifications.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>APG is not  a UI Design System</h2>
        <p>
          While the APG includes a library of patterns and functional examples, it's objectives do not include providing a   comprehensive design system or production-ready code.
          Rather, the examples, including  code style, are designed to facilitate learning the accessibility concepts they illustrate.
          While the examples are intended to be reasonably realistic and utilize modern coding techniques, their purpose is not to teach other dimensions of web engineering.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="audience">
        <h2>Who It's For and What  You Need to Know First</h2>
        <p>
          While some parts of APG content assumes some understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is intended to serve a broad audience of people who work to ensure web content is accessible. It may be particularly useful to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designers and engineers who are working on site design systems and component libraries.</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that the APG only covers a portion of what is needed to create accessible experiences.
          To understand accessibility more broadly, it is advisable to start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">WAI Accessibility Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/">WAI Overview of Design and Development</a>.

      <section id="organization">
        <h2>How  the APG is Organized</h2>
        <p>
          The APG is organized into two major sections: patterns and practices.
          Each pattern explains how to make a common user interface element, such as a button, menu, or dialog, accessible, and provides functional example implementations of the pattern.
          The practices section gives in-depth explanation of how to satisfy a variety of accessibility needs that surface when making rich internet application experiences accessible.
          For instance, the practices section on providing accessible names and descriptions gives detailed descriptions of seven different naming techniques as well as a table providing guidance for naming more than 80 types of elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APG describes accessibility semantics and keyboard interaction for many common user interface patterns, ranging from typical buttons and popup menus to complex tree grids.
          The patterns are illustrated by functional example code and linked to explanations of fundamental accessibility practices they incorporate.
          Practices cover topics such as how to effectively utilize the many ways of encoding accessible names and convey web page structure with ARIA landmark regions.
